    Notes
    - If looking for a text kernel, finds the last (highest priority) kernel of the given type, no matter what object it may have data for.
      Consequently, this only works well when data for only one spacecraft is loaded.
    - If looking for a binary kernel, you may pass an array of times. Return value is a list of kernels which provide data for this object
      at each time, or None if there is no kernel that covers the matching time. There is a one-to-one in-order relation between the list
      of times passed in and the list of files returned.
    - Return path is what was given in furnsh() (or in a furnished metakernel), and is either absolute or relative to what the current
      directory was at the time the kernel was furnished.
    - For performance reasons, this code keeps a cache in the form of function attribute. The cache is loaded whenever /flush is set, or
      the current cache is empty, or the requested object changes. Cache performs best therefore when you ask for coverage for the same object
      repeatedly, and switch objects a minimum number of times. You should pass /flush if you know that the kernels have changed since
      the last time you called which_kernel, because checking that the kernel list hasn't changed would take up too much time and invalidate
      a lot of the performance gain the cache provides.
